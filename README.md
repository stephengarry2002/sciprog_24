## Introduction

This is my Repo for the 2024/25 Scientific Programming Concepts Module. This master file will be update each time a practical is added to the github.

## Practical 3

* Added on 17/10/2024

* Estimates the integral of $tan(x)$ using trapazoidal rule

## Practical 4

* Added on 22/10/2024

* Improves upon practical 3, by using function, arrays, and loops

## Practical 5 

* Added on 22/10/2024

* Writes the fibonacci series up to n digits, where n is specified to the user

* Approximates the value of arctanh(x) between x = [-0.9,0.9] using Maclaurin series up to a certain percision specified by the user.

* Compares this to a natural log approximation of arctanh(x) on the same interval. 

## Practical 6

* Added on 30/10/2024

* Writes a code to do matrix multiplication with a given matrix

* Compiles this code in different ways

* Compiles this code normally and seperatly by joining files together during compilation
