# Practical 8
This practical involves using different forms of Euclids algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two integers. This code uses both an iterative and recursive version of Euclids algorithm.

## How to Compile
Use the following line of code to compile the c source code:

* gcc -o GCD GCD.c

## How to Execute
Use the folloing line of code execute the compiled source code:

* ./GCD

# Outputs

* This code asks the user to input two positive integers and returns an error if not done so properly

* It will return the greatest common divisor using both the iterative and recursive algorithms and prints them out respectivly.
